## We Know... We Know - Installing Unpacked Extensions Suck

We're sorry about that. We're in the process of getting this extension listed on the Chrome Web Store so that anyone can download and use it.

However, for the short duration till that doesn't happen, here is how you can load the unpacked extension.

### Disclaimer : This extensions is only supported on Chromium based browsers. If you can download extensions from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/), you’ll be on the Chromium platform. Most modern browsers (like Vivaldi, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Epic Privacy Browser, SlimBrowser, Torch and obviously Google Chrome) are built on the Chromium platform. 

## Loading Unpacked Extension

We usually make small changes here and there but we often create a release out of the changes we made. Therefore, we highly recommend you getting the [latest release](https://github.com/JaiRelan/know-your-bias/releases/).

- Download the latest .zip or tar.gz file from [this link](https://github.com/JaiRelan/know-your-bias/releases/)
- Unzip the folder and leave it in an easy to access location.
- Open a new tab and type `chrome://extensions`
- Click on the button called `Developer Mode` on the top right.
- Click on the `Load Unpacked` button.
- Select the folder where the unzipped content lies. There is no need to go inside the folder… Just grab the outer-most directory of the folder. Click `Okay`
- And Vola! 

Feel free to just [create an Issue](https://github.com/JaiRelan/know-your-bias/issues/new) if you need help with anything.

I always was pretty scared of creating issues especially at the expense of sounding dumb, so I’ll try to help you out even if it’s a super basic question.
