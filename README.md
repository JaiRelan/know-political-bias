# Know Your Bias

All the data for the chrome extension is sourced from All Sides. We obtained this data from an open source repository of Github from them and then used the values from row #1 and #2 for the current extension. Down the line, we plan on integrating the other data-points, but that’s all for another day.

The idea behind this extension is simple - we all know that some journalists/publications have political biases which they conciously or subconciously project to their readers throught their articles and publication. All Sides has compiled an index of the bias ratings if quite a few media houses from accross the globe. However, the problem remains that most people are not aware that these rankings exist and even if they are, opening up the AllSides website and finding the ranking of the url they’re on is too much work.

Our simple chrome extension tries to banish that problem. Simply pressing on the ‘Know Your Bias’ icon in the menu bar would show you a popup giving you a message telling you the ating of the website you’re currently on.
