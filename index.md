## Welcome to Know-Your-Bias

### **Know Your Bias** is a simple Chrome extension which helps you understand the bias behind the websites you source your news from. 

All the data for the chrome extension is sourced from [All Sides](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings). We obtained this data from an [open source repository of Github](https://github.com/favstats/AllSideR/blob/master/data/allsides_data.csv) from them and then used the values from row #1 and #2 for the current extension. Down the line, we plan on integrating the other data-points, but that's all for another day.

This extension was built by [Jai Relan](https://twitter.com/JaiRelan) and [Swayam Sidh Tripathy](https://twitter.com/sidh_swayam)
